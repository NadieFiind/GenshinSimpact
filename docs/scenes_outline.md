- The traveler just finished a commission that took almost the whole day.
He wasn't able to come and watch the fireworks with Keqing.
The traveler quickly came to Keqing's house.

- Keqing is sad because the traveler didn't come.
She was excited to show the traveler her new dress so she was really sad.
Keqing waited for a while still hoping for the traveler to come.
After some time, Keqing decided to go back to her house.

- Keqing put off her dress and rested.
The traveler is now at Keqing's house.
He knocked on her door, and Keqing panicked.
Unfortunately, Keqing is not wearing the dress anymore.
He apologized and set a plan for a date tomorrow evening.

- The traveler and Keqing met at Liuli Pavilion.
Keqing was a little bit earlier than the traveler.
They sat and ordered food.
Keqing is a little disappointed because the traveler didn't comment anything about her dress.
But deep inside the traveler, he really liked Keqing's dress and got turned on.
After eating and talking, the traveler wanted to come to Keqing's house.
Keqing got surprised but she couldn't say no because she also wants the traveler to come over.

- After they arrived, the traveler finally said to Keqing that he really likes her dress.
Keqing blushed and is speechless.
The traveler wants to take a closer look at Keqing's dress.
Keqing posed in an erotic way.
The traveler got hard and turned on and couldn't control himself.
He touched Keqing out of horniness. Keqing didn't resist and she submits herself to the traveler.
And then the good part finally happened.
After the good part, they've fallen asleep.
The end.
